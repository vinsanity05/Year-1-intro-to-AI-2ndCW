The task is to use C programming to create a Machine Learning algorithm that can learn predictive Rule-Based models, using a greedy hill-climbing approach.
This task will help me understand how a search-based framework can be used to solve different problems, gain experience of the practical issues around creating machine learning
systems, and demonstrate that I can implement a simple Machine Learning algorithm.
